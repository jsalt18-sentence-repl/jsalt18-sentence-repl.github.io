## What?

We are a team of researchers participating in the six-week [JSALT 2018](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) in-person intensive research summer camp at the [CLSP](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University.

*Research proposal:* Our group will work to improve the ability of artificial neural network models to represent and understand sentence meaning. Candidate systems will be evaluated on their ability to solve a suite language understanding tasks using a single shared sentence encoder component, combined with a set of ten lightweight task-specific attention models. We expect to explore new methods for unsupervised learning, new objectives and techniques for multi-task and transfer learning, and new methods for linguistically sophisticated error analysis. 

We use baselines and metrics from the [GLUE](https://gluebenchmark.com) benchmark suite. 

Because we study [ELMo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmo), and because JSALT provides cookies generously, our mascot is [Cookie Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Monster).
